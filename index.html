		<h1>About Michael Lee</h1>
		<img  src="images/michael.png" alt="Image of Michael"/>
		<p>I am a graduate of all BS in Mathematics.  I am an avid disco dancer and
			thinking of starting my own 70's club.  My best friend is an Elvis impersonator that
			I met in the year I spent in Santa Fe prior to this September, when I moved
			to Albuquerque for the first time.
		</p>
		<p>
			I tend to like independent films or films with interesting character
			development.  Some of my favorites are Little House on the Prairie, Lego Movie, and
			films directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  I am not afraid to occasionally indulge in
			horror films, such as Forest Gump, which I appreciate for the way they stylishly
			scare the living daylights out of me.
